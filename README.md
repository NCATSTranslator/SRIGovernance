# Translator Governance

Welcome to the Translator Governance repository. 

We have created set of preliminary documents to assist in the formalization of the governance process for the Biomedical Data Translator and to clarify how decisions are made and how the various elements of our community interact. 

These documents establish a decision-making structure that takes into account feedback from all members of the Translator community and strives to find consensus, while avoiding deadlocks.

For now, we have generated these documents from a Google Document collection and released them as a preliminary PDF. Once these documents are agreed upon, we will move each one to a Markdown file for change management within this repository.
We welcome all suggestions from anyone.
